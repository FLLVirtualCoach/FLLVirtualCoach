#  First Lego League Challenge - FLL Virtual Coach 

## Project Purpose
This project is intended to provide ![FirstLogo](/Images/FIRST.png) First Lego League Challenge (FLL)  ROOKIE & NOVICE teams with a set of interactive tools that they can use to kickstart their FLL team. These tools leverage modern Generative AI platforms (such as ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot) to help new teams find inspiration and demonstrate how to assemble the key the components assessed by FLL judges.

## Get Started
The prompts are broken into groups. You copy and paste the prompts into your AI of choice and then answer the questions you get back from the AI. You can mix and match prompts from the same column (but this may not always work).  Click on the links below to access the prompts.

> [!TIP]
> If your team is finding it difficult to interact with AI tools by "typing" (i.e. because they are young or have limited experience), consider encouraging them to use their device's speech-to-text function. Instructions here for [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-voice-typing-to-talk-instead-of-type-on-your-pc-fec94565-c4bd-329d-e59a-af033fa5689f), [MacOS](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mh40584/mac), and [ChromeOS](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/12001244?hl=en).

## A Helping Hand
Only 1/4th of a FLL team's performance is based on their performance "at the table" (actually competing with their robot).  3/4ths of an FLL team's score is based on judge-assessed scores against using FLL scoring rubric.  The judges use a rubric assesses a team's Innovation Project, Robot presentation, and Core Values. The 30-45 minutes that a team spends with the judges is the **_most important_** time during the FLL competition.  Unfortunately, it's hard to know what your team is expected to deliver during their first few competitions (as teams don't get to watch other teams present). This project intends to provide some guidance to rookie or novice teams in order to achieve success on the judged portions of the competition (as they have more than enough tasks to worry about getting started with the competition).  This project will provide a resource that can help teams know "what to do" so they can focus on "doing it"!

## Wait! Isn't this "Cheating"?
Is having an experienced coach cheating? Of course a good coach isn't cheating (and neither is using the FLL Virtual Coach).  This tool provides templates and tools to enhance the team's ideas and efforts, just like an experienced coach. While a team could COPY these outputs in their entirety, the outputs themselves are not sufficient to compete in the competition.  Teams will have to actually "show their work" when presenting to the judges and no amount of coaching can substitute for the hard work of the teams.  These prompts provide guidance and inspiration but do not provide substantive assistance (i.e. primary research, making phone calls, testing and iteration). These tools level the playing field for new teams who have coaches that are also still learning.  If you're a mature FLL team with competition experience (or an experienced coach), this project is unlikely to provide new information for your coaches or team members.
